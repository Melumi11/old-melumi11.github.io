            <p>In reality, no one is immune from racial bias. Everyone's view of the world is at least partially based on race. There is no such thing as racially impartial and nobody is free from their own prejudices. Humans evolved this way to keep themselves safe, and no technology exists in the world that can change this fact. As famous writer Kan Gao once remarked, "I think all our memories, and everything in it… can be nothing but the fiction we tell ourselves."</p>

            <p>Many people, especially white people can’t see the small microaggressions that occur in their daily lives. Even through art depicting struggle and death, publicly or privatly displayed, peoples’ opinions are not easily changed until they themselves are put on the spot.</p>
